# Performing Calculations on a GPU

This example was taken from https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/basic_tasks_and_concepts/performing_calculations_on_a_gpu

## Overview

This code snipped uses Apples' Metal Shading Language to run a convolution operation on the GPU. The performance of the M1 GPU is compared with a NVidia Tesla M60 from Skoltechs' Zhores supercomputer, as well as GPUs from Google Colab.
